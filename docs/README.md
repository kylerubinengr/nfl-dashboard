## Adding Documentation

When adding new documentation:

1. **Testing docs** → `/docs/`
2. **Code reviews** → `/docs/reviews/` (with date in filename)
3. **Design decisions** → `/docs/decisions/` (ADR format recommended)
4. **Implementation summaries** → `/docs/archive/` (after completion)
5. **Active docs** → Keep in root or `/docs/` based on relevance

## Archiving Documentation

Move completed implementation docs to `/docs/archive/` to keep root clean while preserving history for reference.
